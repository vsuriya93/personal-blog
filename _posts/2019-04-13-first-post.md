_TL;DR - Introducing myself and the scope of this blog_

Hi Folks,

This is my first time exploring jekyll blogging. I write content on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science. I hope to update my blog weekly.

##### What to expect

Mainly content on ML. It is said, _you have to fight a battle more than once to win it._ Documenting all my learning and understanding helps me to quickly review, learn and share with the community of ML-Enthusiasts.

##### Looks like Medium

True. I forked my code from [here](https://wowthemesnet.github.io/mediumish-theme-jekyll/). The creator here has done a great work. It took approximately 2-3 hrs to set up.

In this process I roughly figured out

1. Jekyll blogging
2. HTML/CSS - _for formatting and outline_
3. [Disqus](https://disqus.com/home/explore/) - _integrating with comments_
4. [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) - _forms, subscribe etc_

```python
success = False
while(!success):
  success = _try()
```
